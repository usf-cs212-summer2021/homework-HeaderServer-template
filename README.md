HeaderServer
=================================================

For this homework, you will create a simple Jetty web server that allows users enter a URL and view the HTTP headers for that URL.

Specifically, you must do the following for this assignment:

1. **`HeaderServer.main():`** Start a Jetty web server on port 8080 and map `/check` to the `HeaderServlet` servlet.

1. **`HeaderServer.getHttpHeaders(URL):`** Use the `HttpsFetcher` methods to send a `HEAD` request for the provided URL and return the HTTP headers (no content). **Do NOT send a GET request to the web server!**

1. **`HeaderServer.HeaderServlet.doGet()`** This servlet should display a simple web form configured to use the `GET` HTTP method that allows users to enter a link and press a button to display the HTTP headers for that link. If the appropriate link parameter is present in the `GET` request, the servlet should also fetch and **safely** display the HTTP headers for the provided link. The servlet should reasonably protect against malicious content contained within those headers. If the servlet is unable to fetch the headers for any reason, display a message on the web page instead. **Do NOT override the `doPost` method for this assignment!**

This is an **extra credit** homework assignment. It may be used to make up for points missed on earlier homework assignments. **Unless otherwise stated, extra credit may not be used to earn over a 100% grade within any category.**

## Examples ##

The following is one example implementation of this assignment. When a valid link is provided, the resulting web page might look as follows:

![valid](src/main/resources/valid.png)

When an invalid link is provided, the resulting web page might look as follows:

![invalid](src/main/resources/invalid.png)

A `<pre>` tag is used to display the header text in the above examples, but you can decide to format the headers using a table as well.

The basic HTML generated by the servlet (with no link) looks as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>Headers!</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<!-- form -->
		<h3>Get Headers</h3>
		<form method="get" action="/headers">
			<p><input type="text" name="link" maxlength="2000" size="75"/></p>
			<p><input type="submit" value="Fetch Headers!"></p>
		</form>
	</body>
</html>
```

However, the HTML returned by your servlet does not need to match this.
